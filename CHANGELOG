decode-Hall-symbol (unreleased)

  * Changed:
    - Moving Hall and H-M symbol decoding routines to separate
      packages so that they can be reused outside of the provided
      programs.

decode-Hall-symbol (0.1.3)

  * Changed:
    - programs 'decode_hall', 'decode_hm':
      - accepting both inverese and direct change-of-basis operators
        (i.e. both "abc"-containing, like "(a-b,a+b,c)", and "xyz"
        containing, like "(x-y,x+y,z)").

decode-Hall-symbol (0.1.2)

  * Added:
    - program 'decode_hm':
        - Adding default settings for monoclinic groups;
        - Adding short H-M symbols with default settings for
          monoclinic groups.

  * Fixed:
    - program 'decode_hm':
        - BUG FIX: correcting application of the change-of-basis
          matrix to the centering operators;
        - BUG FIX: making sure that duplicate operators are not
          inserted after the change-of-basis;

decode-Hall-symbol (0.1.1)

  * Added:
    - program 'decode_shmueli':
        - decodes explicit Shmueli symbols (e.g. 'PAC$I1A000');
    - program 'decode_hm':
        - decodes Hermann-Mauguin symbol, both short and universal,
	  with optional shift-of-origin and change-of-basis
	  designators.

decode-Hall-symbol (0.1.0)

  * Initial release.

  * Added:
    - program 'decode_hall':
      - adding capability to decode any Hall symbol from the (Hall 1981) paper;
      - adding capability to decode shift-of-origin;
      - adding capability to decode change-of-basis (as in ITC vol. B, 2001);
      - implementing option '--help';
      - implementing option '--version' and package versioning support.
